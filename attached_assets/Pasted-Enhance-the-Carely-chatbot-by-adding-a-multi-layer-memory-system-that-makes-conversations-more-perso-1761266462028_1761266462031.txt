Enhance the Carely chatbot by adding a multi-layer memory system that makes conversations more personal, contextual, and adaptive.

Use only free, open-source tools for all layers — no paid APIs or hosted services.
 
1. Short-Term Memory
Implement a simple conversation buffer to retain the last 10–15 exchanges for immediate context.
Use in-memory storage (e.g., Python list, deque, or a lightweight local cache).
This ensures smooth and coherent dialogue flow without relying on any external API.
 
2. Long-Term Memory
Create a local vector-based retrieval system for recalling relevant past conversations.
Use sentence-transformers (like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or bge-small-en) for generating free embeddings.
Store embeddings in a local database such as FAISS or Chroma (self-hosted mode) — both free and open source.
Retrieve semantically similar memories when the user brings up related topics.
 
3. Structured Memory
Use SQLite with SQLModel to store structured user data, including:
medications: name, dosage, timing
user_profiles: preferences, routines, family info
health_data: key health facts or conditions
Allow the chatbot to query this structured memory for precise, factual responses — such as medication schedules or daily habits.
For example, it should be able to accurately answer the questions like :

what medications do I take? Do you remember what we chatted about earlier? could you remind me what did I have for breakfast? Remind me my medication schedule?
 
4. Episodic Memory
Generate daily summaries of important interactions (topics, mood, health updates).
Summaries can be created using a free local summarization model such as T5-small or BART-base from Hugging Face Transformers.
Store each summary locally with a timestamp to identify long-term patterns like mood trends or medication adherence.
 
Integration and Behavior
Combine all four layers into a unified memory manager:
Short-term → keeps immediate dialogue context.
Long-term → retrieves semantically related past conversations.
Structured → holds factual, queryable data.
Episodic → tracks daily summaries and long-range insights.
Ensure all layers work locally and can run efficiently on free Replit or local environments.
Keep the system modular — each layer should function independently and be easy to extend or replace later.
 
Goal
 
Add these specific features:
Persistent Memory Storage
Intelligent Memory Retrieval
Function to recall medication schedules when asked
Ability to summarize recent conversations from history
Retrieve specific daily logs (like breakfast)
Access user preferences and routines
Context-Aware Responses
Check database before answering personal questions
Reference past conversations when users ask "remember what we talked about?"
Provide accurate medication info from stored data
Recall daily activities from logs
Memory Initialization & Updates
Setup prompts to collect initial medication schedules

Ability to learn and store new personal preferences

Make Carely capable of:
Remembering both short-term and long-term context,
Using structured data for accuracy,
Summarizing key events for emotional continuity, and
Operating fully on free, local, open-source technologies — no API costs or dependencies on paid services.
